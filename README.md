## Script Development
[Squirrel Documentation](http://www.squirrel-lang.org/squirreldoc/reference/index.html) | [API Documentation](https://sneakyevil.gitbook.io/sleeping-dogs-de-script-api/)
- I recommend using VS Code and installing extension: [Squirrel Language Supports](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=marcinbar.vscode-squirrel)
- If you want to use snippets you can create under the __Scripts__ folder called __.vscode__ and download this file inside the folder: [squirrel.code-snippets](squirrel.code-snippets), after that you can open the __Scripts__ folder inside VS Code to be able to use snippets.
